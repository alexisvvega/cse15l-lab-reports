## Part 1 – Debugging Scenario
What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?

Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.

Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.

## Part 2 – Reflection
During the second half of the quarter, I learned about vim and its various commands and features. Vim is a text editor that has a wide range of functionalities and modes such as normal, insert and visual. Within these modes there are many cool features and navigation techniques through the use of your keys on your keyboard. 
~~~
h
~~~
moves your cursor to the left one line
~~~
l
~~~
moves your cursor to the right one line 
~~~
j
~~~
moves your cursor down one line
~~~
k
~~~
moves your cursor up one line
~~~
x
~~~
deletes what your cursor is on
~~~
:wq
~~~
saves your edits and quits
Those are some of the many features I was able to learn through vim and it was one of the most interesting subjects we discussed. Walking through the tutorial on our terminal was really fun and was what made me learn it the best, making it my favorite topic discussed second half of the quarter.
